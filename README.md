# Custom Display-Post-Processing Private Preview

## Overview

Automatic Speech Recognition output display format is critical to downstream tasks and one-size doesnâ€™t fit all. Custom Display-Post-Processing (aka "Custom DPP") allows users to define their own lexical-to-display format rules to improve the speech recognition service quality on top of [Microsoft Azure Custom Speech Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/custom-speech-overview).

## Get start with Custom DPP CLI

The Custom DPP command-line utility presents easy-to-use commands for display format customization.

See the [Get Start](GETSTART.md) document about how to download and use the CLI tool to upload, evaluate, and deploy your custom display format models.

See the [Concept](CONCEPTS.md) document about the basic concepts of Microsoft display post processing.

Available Commands:
* `init` - Create and init a project, scaffolding it with template files
* `push` - Push the custom model files or test set to Microsoft Speech server
* `eval` - Evaluate the latest model pushed to the Microsoft Speech server
* `deploy` - Deploy a custom DPP model and bind to a custom speech model
* `get` - Get model, test set, evaluation or deployment detail information from Microsoft Speech server

### Find help from your command prompt

For convenience, consider adding the Custom DPP CLI location to your system path for ease of use. That way you can type `cdpp` from any directory on your system.

To see a list of commands, type `cdpp -h` and then press the ENTER key.

To learn about a specific command, just include the name of the command (For example: `cdpp push -h`).

If you choose not to add Custom DPP CLI to your path, you'll have to change directories to the location of your `cdpp` executable and type `cdpp` or `.\cdpp` in Windows PowerShell command prompts.


## Frequently asked questions

### Is unified speech-to-text service supported?
Not in private preview version. You have to specify a custom speech modelID (from [Custom Speech Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/custom-speech-overview)) in order to enable Custom DPP builders. Unified Speech-to-text service without model customiztaion can only benifited from Microsoft built-in DPP base builders.

### Is Bring-Your-Own-Storage (BYOS) supported?

Not yet. We are trying to support this in public preview. Learn more about Speech Service BYOS at [Speech service encryption of data at rest](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-encryption-of-data-at-rest).
