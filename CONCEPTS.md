## Display Post Processing Overview

Microsoft Speech service provides many display format *base features*, such as *ITN*, *capitalization*, *reformulation*, and *profanity masking/removal*, etc.. As the name implied, each *feature* is a specific task for display format processing. The Custom DPP rules work together with the *base featurs* to form the display post processing pipeline of Microsoft Speech service. Please see the article [Display post processing overview](CONCEPTS.md#display-post-processing-overview) for more details about the *base features* and how they work tegother with the Custom DPP rules.
